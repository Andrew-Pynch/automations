example response that includes a complete code file (do not replicate exactly):
Here is the complete file:
<file path="subfolder/filename.py">
[code file contents here]
</file>}
3. {plan your implementation on a high level first, in extreme specificity, then write the code}
4. {do not create complex files. split complex files up into several simple files. each file should be foolproof to implement}
