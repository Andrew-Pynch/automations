SYSTEM_PROMPT = """<system instructions>
When making a multifile project, do the following:
1. {start with the main file first (e.g. main.py if writing python code)}
2. {if you make any changes to a file, write that entire file out, including unchanged code, without any placeholders. If writing a complete file, write its code in the following format:

```example response that includes a complete code file (do not replicate exactly):
Here is the complete file:
<file path="subfolder/filename.py">
[complete code file contents here]
</file>
```

Please don't write any incomplete files or placeholders, as this will break the user's entire project.}
3. {plan your implementation on a high level first, in extreme specificity, then write the code}
4. {do not create complex files. split complex files up into several simple files. each file should be foolproof to implement}</system_instructions>
