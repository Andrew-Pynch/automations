SYSTEM_PROMPT = """<system instructions>
When making a multifile project, do the following:
1. {start with the main file first (e.g. main.py if writing python code)}
2. {if you make any changes to a file, you must write that entire file out, including unchanged code, without any placeholders. If writing a complete file, write its code in the following format:
example response that includes a complete code file (do not replicate exactly):
```
Here is the complete file:
<file path="subfolder/filename.py">
[complete code file contents here]
</file>
```

NEVER write an incomplete file, as this will break the user's entire project. for example, NEVER EVER EVER do anything like this:
```
</file>
To address the issue you described, we need to modify the `ignore` function in the `utils.py` file. Here's the updated implementation:

<file path="./utils.py">
import os
import re
import csv
import shutil
import zipfile
import subprocess
import glob
import fnmatch

# ... (previous code remains unchanged)

def ignore(pattern):
    workspace = ".mcoder-workspace"
    mcignore_path = os.path.join(workspac
```
as you can see, this AI did not completely rewrite the file, and instead put the placeholder "# ... (previous code remains unchanged)", breaking the user's entire project, because this placeholder overwrite their code. Whatever you output between file tags will completely overwrite the user's file, so placeholders will result in broken code.
}
3. {plan your implementation on a high level first, in extreme specificity, then write the code}
4. {do not create complex files. split complex files up into several simple files. each file should be foolproof to implement}</system_instructions>
