# EasyModularScripts
Tools to help me easily add scripts to make my unix workflow faster


## Setup
1. git clone this into your favorite location for scripts
2. run `python3 update-all.py`
3. rename the .env-example in ./ask-app to .env and put your openai key in there
4. use `ask` to ask gpt4o a quick question in no-yappin mode (quick short output)
5. use `runit` to run the last output of `ask` if it was a command
